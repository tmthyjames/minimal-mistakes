title: "Achoo (beta 0.1): A Predictive Ashtma Alert System"
author_profile: true
author: Tim Dobbins
excerpt: Achoo is my way of tracking my son's allergies and asthma. For the longest time we couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused his asthmatic episodes. Hopefully this tool will help us track those causes.
